# Analysis of structural connectivity on progression of Alzheimer's Disease using Diffusion Tensor Imaging

I presented my thesis work as a paper in International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN) 2017. The proceedings were published in IEEE Xplore. (Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8085686)
I have also attached my paper "ICSCN_175 pdf" in the repository.
